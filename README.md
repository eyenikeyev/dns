<h1 align = "center">Understanding & Building Intuition for DNS (Domain Name System)</h1>
This lab demonstrates the use of DNS and how to configure it. DNS serves as the phonebook of the Internet, translating domain names to IP addresses so browsers can load Internet resources (essentially why we don't need to type IP addresses to access Google.com). To see how it works in practice, this lab follows up from the <a href = "https://github.com/ColtonTrauCC/active-directory">installation and configuration of an Active Directory</a>. When configured and installed, we'll perform excercises with the client and domain controller virtual machines in order to understand DNS a bit better.
